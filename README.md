# BatDictionary

This project aims to identify sequences of bat chirps which occur frequently in bat communication so that biologists might be able to discern contextual meaning from recordings of bats in the wild.  

This project analyzes 41,774 bat chirps from 2929 different recordings collected from an outdoor microphone at Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve between 01/02/2022 and 02/09/2022, and uses Graph Attention Transformers and HDBSCAN to identify clusters of acoustically similar chirp sequences. 

I received invaluable mentorship for this project from Andreas Paepcke, research scientist at Stanford University.
